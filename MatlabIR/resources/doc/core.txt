JAVADOC_BEGIN:ParenthesisNode

 Parentheses are used to indicate precedence in arithmetic expressions in the usual way. They are used to enclose
 arguments of functions in the usual way. They are also used to enclose subscripts of vectors and matrices in a manner
 somewhat more general than usual. If X and V are vectors, then X(V) is [X(V(1)), X(V(2)), ..., X(V(n))]. The
 components of V must be integers to be used as subscripts. An error occurs if any such subscript is less than 1 or
 greater than the size of X.
 
 <p>
 Each children token of parenthesis is considered as a single, separate element. E.g., (1, 2, 3)

JAVADOC_BEGIN:MType

 Types of the tokens in the MatLab tree representation.

 Content in most tokens are strings, to increase compatibility with TOM Loria framework. <br>
 Also, all types should be in this file, while TOM framework is used, because of generator.
